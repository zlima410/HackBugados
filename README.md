Step-by-Step Guide to Building the Expense Management Tool with React, Next.js, and Supabase
Step 1: Set Up the Project

    Create a Next.js Project:
        Install Node.js and npm if you haven't already.
        Create a new Next.js project:

        bash

    npx create-next-app@latest expense-management-tool
    cd expense-management-tool

Set Up Supabase:

    Sign up for Supabase and create a new project.
    In your Supabase dashboard, create a new database schema to store user data, transactions, and categories.

Install Dependencies:

    Install the required packages for your project:

    bash

        npm install @supabase/supabase-js react-hook-form axios

        @supabase/supabase-js: Supabase client for interacting with your database.

        react-hook-form: For handling forms and form validation.

        axios: For making HTTP requests if needed.

Step 2: Set Up Supabase Database

    Create Tables in Supabase:
        Users: To store user information.
        Transactions: To store transaction details.
        Categories: To categorize transactions.

    Example schema for Transactions:

    sql

    CREATE TABLE Transactions (
      id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
      user_id uuid REFERENCES Users(id),
      amount numeric,
      description text,
      category_id uuid REFERENCES Categories(id),
      transaction_date timestamp,
      created_at timestamp DEFAULT current_timestamp
    );

    Insert Some Initial Data:
        Add a few categories (e.g., Food, Transportation, Entertainment) to the Categories table to get started.

Step 3: Connect Next.js with Supabase

    Initialize Supabase:
        Create a new file lib/supabaseClient.js:

        javascript

    import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

    const supabaseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL;
    const supabaseKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY;
    const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey);

    export default supabase;

Set Environment Variables:

    Create a .env.local file in the root of your project:

    bash

        NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
        NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key

Step 4: Create the User Interface

    Create the Layout:
        In pages/_app.js, set up a basic layout with a navigation bar and footer.
        Use a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS or Chakra UI for styling.

    Create Pages:
        Home Page (index.js): Display an overview of the user's spending.
        Add Transaction Page (add-transaction.js): Allow users to input new transactions.
        Transactions Page (transactions.js): Display a list of all transactions with filtering options.

    Create Forms for Adding Transactions:
        Use react-hook-form to handle the form submissions.
        Example:

        javascript

        import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';
        import supabase from '../lib/supabaseClient';

        export default function AddTransaction() {
          const { register, handleSubmit, reset } = useForm();

          const onSubmit = async (data) => {
            const { error } = await supabase
              .from('Transactions')
              .insert([{ ...data, user_id: 'your-user-id' }]);
            if (!error) {
              reset();
            }
          };

          return (
            <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
              <input {...register('amount')} placeholder="Amount" required />
              <input {...register('description')} placeholder="Description" required />
              <select {...register('category_id')}>
                <option value="category1-id">Category 1</option>
                <option value="category2-id">Category 2</option>
              </select>
              <button type="submit">Add Transaction</button>
            </form>
          );
        }

Step 5: Implement Authentication

    Set Up Auth with Supabase:
        Use Supabase’s built-in authentication for user login and registration.
        Example in pages/auth.js:

        javascript

    import { useState } from 'react';
    import supabase from '../lib/supabaseClient';

    export default function Auth() {
      const [email, setEmail] = useState('');

      const handleLogin = async () => {
        const { error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOtp({ email });
        if (!error) alert('Check your email for the login link!');
      };

      return (
        <div>
          <input
            type="email"
            value={email}
            onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
            placeholder="Enter your email"
          />
          <button onClick={handleLogin}>Send Magic Link</button>
        </div>
      );
    }

Protect Routes:

    In pages/_app.js, check if the user is logged in using Supabase's auth session:

    javascript

        import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
        import supabase from '../lib/supabaseClient';

        function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
          const [session, setSession] = useState(null);

          useEffect(() => {
            const session = supabase.auth.session();
            setSession(session);

            supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange((_event, session) => {
              setSession(session);
            });
          }, []);

          if (!session) return <Auth />;

          return <Component {...pageProps} />;
        }

        export default MyApp;

Step 6: Implement Core Functionality

    Transaction Management:
        Allow users to add, edit, and delete transactions.
        Fetch and display transaction data on the Transactions page.
        Use Supabase's real-time capabilities to update the UI when transactions are added or modified.

    Categorization and Analysis:
        Use basic logic or integrate a simple AI model to categorize transactions automatically.
        Show spending summaries by category on the home page.

Step 7: Testing and Debugging

    Test Core Flows:
        Test user sign-up, login, adding transactions, and viewing data.
        Ensure data is saved correctly in Supabase and displays properly in your UI.

    Debug Issues:
        Use browser dev tools, Next.js’s debugging tools, and Supabase logs to troubleshoot issues.

Step 8: Deploy the App

    Deploy with Vercel:
        Deploy your Next.js app to Vercel for seamless integration.
        Connect your GitHub repo to Vercel and set environment variables in Vercel’s dashboard.

    Supabase Hosting:
        Supabase handles hosting for your database and authentication, so no extra steps are needed.

Step 9: Present the Prototype

    Prepare a Demo:
        Highlight key features like transaction entry, categorization, and expense summaries.
        Show how easy it is for users to track their spending.

    Gather Feedback:
        If possible, get quick feedback from others and iterate on the prototype.

This guide should give you a solid foundation for building your expense management tool with React, Next.js, and Supabase in the hackathon!
